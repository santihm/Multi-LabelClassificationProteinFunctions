# Multi-LabelClassificationProteinFunctions
This repository contains a comprehensive study on predicting protein functions, a problem in biology. Each instance is a protein, and each label represents a protein class. Using the GenBase dataset (662 examples, 1186 binary labels), this practice addresses multi-label classification where each protein may belong to multiple of the 27 classes.
